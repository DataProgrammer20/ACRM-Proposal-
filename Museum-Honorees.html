            <p class="headerText">Dr. George R. Stibitz</p>
            <p class="contentText">Dr. George R. Stibitz (1904-1995) is internationally
                recognized by computer  scientists and historians as the seminal pioneer
                of the modern digital computer. As a mathematical physicist at the AT&T
                Bell Laboratories in 1937 and while performing research on the electromechanical
                properties of telephone relays, he had a hunch that a computer could be built using
                binary numbers with the relays representing ones and zeros using their on and off
                switching characteristics. In November of 1937, on the kitchen table of his home,
                Dr. Stibitz built a two-digit binary adding circuit using two telephone relays,
                two batteries, two light bulbs and a switch fashioned out of a tobacco tin. It was
                dubbed the Model K - for kitchen. In 1938, with the help of S.B. Williams, also of
                Bell Laboratories, he developed a full-scale calculator for the arithmetic of complex
                numbers. This computing machine was fully operational in late 1939 and was demonstrated
                in 1940. Dr. Stibitz used this demonstration to also showcase the first remote controlled
                computer using a teletype in Hanover, New Hampshire (on the Dartmouth campus) while the
                computer itself was in New York City. He joined the Department of Physiology at Dartmouth
                Medical School in 1964 as a research associate on the applications of physics, mathematics,
                and computers to biophysical/biomedical technologies. He became a professor in 1966 and
                professor emeritus in 1970. Dr. Stibitz was awarded 34 patents. Dr. Stibitz built a functioning
                replica of the Model K for the American Computer Museum (the original was dismantled long ago)
                and agreed to have an award named after him to be presented by the American Computer Museum and
                Montana State University that would recognize individuals who have significantly contributed
                to the progress of computing, communications and the information age in general.</p>
